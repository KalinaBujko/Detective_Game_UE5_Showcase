## Detective Willson Helberg – Narrative & Gameplay Design Showcase
This repository presents my personal contributions to the Unreal Engine 5 project Detective Willson Helberg — a branching narrative-driven detective game created over 2 years by a 15-person team.

## My Role: Narrative Designer & Gameplay Programmer
I was responsible for both storytelling and system design, including:

Designing quest structures with branching paths, player choices, and conditional outcomes

Writing in-world documents and interactive lore objects to enrich immersion

Scripting narrative logic, NPC behaviors, and world-state changes

Building the journal system: entry formatting, conditions, and UI implementation

Designing UI and player feedback elements tied to narrative progress

Implementing ambient dialogue and sound cues supporting tone and pacing

Collaborating in Perforce with writers, artists, and designers to ensure narrative consistency

## Repository Contents
This repository contains:

Screenshots and examples of key narrative moments and systems

Blueprints and scripts for quest logic, UI, and interactive storytelling

Development notes and documentation outlining my process

Note: This showcase includes only my personal contributions due to team version control in Perforce.
